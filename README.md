- **Risk Metrics Tracking**: Monitors key performance indicators (KPIs) such as default rate, exposure at default (EAD), and credit utilization.
- **Data Modeling**: Builds a structured data model to consolidate borrower and loan information.
- **Insights Delivery**: Provides actionable insights to improve credit decision accuracy and align with Basel III / IFRS 9 frameworks.
- **Visualization (Optional)**: Dashboards and reports can be generated using Power BI for interactive data exploration.
